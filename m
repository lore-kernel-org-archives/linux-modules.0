Yes, I'll do that on kmod, but we need to pay attention to 2 things:

  - It's possible 2 modules with the same names if they come from
different locations (with different priorities)
  - It doesn't fix the case in which one is a module and the other is
builtin. We could still have problem with such a scenario, like was
pointed out in this bug report to kmod.
